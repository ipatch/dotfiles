## readme / tmux

my super crude readme for setting up tmux

- after copying my provided `tmux.conf` and possibly symlinking as `~/.tmux.conf`
- symlink macos specific tmux conf, ie. related to _reattach-to-user-namespace_
- one will have to clone/install [tpm][tpm]
- then run `prefix, I` to install listed plugins in `~/.tmux.conf`


### todos

- [ ] [obviously][obv], this setup _would be much cooler_ if a single cmd could check, install, set things up, as opposed to the manual intervention listed above.
