## Contents

The files and folders within this directory represent files and folders commonly found within `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or otherwise known as `$HOME/.config`.  However, there is a [brew](https://github.com/ipatch/dotfiles/tree/master/config/brew) directory that is not stored in my personal `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory on macOS, rather this directory is used to store configuration files for software installed via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh) package managers.

> I know, it's probably not the best place to store these files but will work for the time being.  That said, I'll probably relocate the brew directory with the [jobs](https://github.com/ipatch/dotfiles/tree/master/jobs) directory at a later date.
