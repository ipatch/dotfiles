# NOTES
###
# By default, binaries installed by gem will be placed into:
#   /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/bin
#
# You may want to add this to your PATH.
#
# This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because this is an alternate version of another formula.
#
# If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
#   echo 'set -g fish_user_paths "/usr/local/opt/ruby@2.3/bin" $fish_user_paths' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
#
# For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
#     LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/ruby@2.3/lib
#     CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/ruby@2.3/include
# For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
#     PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/ruby@2.3/lib/pkgconfig
