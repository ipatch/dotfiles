## Using asdf with rust

As of June 22 2018 asdf does not play well with [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) ...surprise surprise. 🤷

Fortunately rust provides its own language manager 👍

> Homebrew can cause complications when using the official rust installer, it is adviced to use `rustup` provided by http://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/
