To lint, ie. check a ruby source file for syntax errors

### Working with system / shell commands in ruby files [üîù](#contents)

To execute a shell command within a Ruby source file

```ruby
`echo 'hello from shell`
```

An alternative to the above syntax is to use **system** instead of a pair of back ticks, ie. <kbd>\`</kbd><kbd>\`</kbd>

```ruby
system "echo 'hello from shell'"
```

> I had better results using back ticks as opposed to using **system** for storing information into and out of variables.
