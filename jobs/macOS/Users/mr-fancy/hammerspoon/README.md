## Working with Hammerspoon

I have both **Dock icon** and **menu icon** disabled in the **Hammerspoon Preferences**, that said **Hammerspoon.app** can be accessed via Spotlight <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>␣</kbd> **aka** <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>spacebar</kbd>.

**Hammerspoon** makes setting up an a _Virtual Numpad_ on a MacBook keyboard somewhat manageable, which is convenient when working with apps such as [**Blender &nearr;**](https://www.blender.org/).

- **Hammerspoon** defaults to storing configuration files, ie. **init.lua** in **$HOME/.hamerspoon**

- **Hammerspoon** APIs do not have features to distinguish between a _right command key_ press from a _left command key_ press, and thus is should be relied up [**Karabiner-Element**](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) &nearr;
