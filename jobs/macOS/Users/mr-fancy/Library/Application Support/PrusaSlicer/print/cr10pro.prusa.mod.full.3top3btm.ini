notes = - september 4, 2020, printed the eaxis cable holder using petg at 255ºC with no cooling in a "vertical position"\n\n- x carriage bottom cover uses 2x m3x72mm bolts to hold the cover\n- x carriage top requires 4 M3 bolts\n\n\n\n\n## NOTES\n\n- printing parts at 250ºC with the feed rate set to ~ 80% seems to be printing decent parts along with good support structures\n\n## TODOs\n\n- need to get 2x multisert 136-M3 for x carriage assembly\n- need, FKM3 Square, qty 3x
