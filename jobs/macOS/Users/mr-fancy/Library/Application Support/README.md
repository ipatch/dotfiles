## OBS Settings

The **obs-studio** directory contained one level down from this directory is a direct copy of my OBS settings from macOS _10.13.6_ circa November 2019.  There is another directory named **obs-exports** which contains the settings from OBS using the builtin **export** features within the OBS app itself, as oppsed to directly copying the settings beneath the **Application Support** directory on macOS.
