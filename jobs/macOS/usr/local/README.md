_For future me_ 👴🏻

this file was checked into this repo when I was experimenting with creating symlinks on macOS for devices stored within the `/dev` directory, ie. create a symlink for devices such as a Bus Pirate, and create a link to the physical device, ie. `/dev/ttyAblahblahbhasomething` and have the linked named something like `/dev/buspirate`.

## TODOs

- [ ] never completed the link task, macOS can be a PITA more often than not, when getting closer to the metal.
