## Debian / Initial Setup 

## setup fish as default shell

the `default_shell_setup.sh` script should setup fish shell as the default shell if this dotfiles repo is cloned and the script is run from a CLI.

## TODOs

- [ ] add more info to this README
- [ ] add to `default_shell_setup.sh` to install my custom term entries, so apps such as tmux do not error when starting, and prevent other appps such as weechat from launching.
