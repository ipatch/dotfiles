## arch/macbook _11.x_ specific

<a name="arch-on-macbook">

i checked the `$PWD/etc/default/grub` file to help me remember adding `acpi_mask_gpe=0x06` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` argument. after adding this arg to above such line the computer went from idling at ~ 70C üî• to idling around ~ 40C ~= 100F ü•∂

### troubleshooting / fail to boot üò≠

<a name="tshoot-fail-to-boot"></a>

**my rant**, boot failures always suck and happen at the worst time ü§¶

**TL;DR** ‚ùóÔ∏è make sure `/boot` partition is writable when upgrading `linux` and `linux-headers`, for me my HFS `/boot` partition was mounted as _read-only_. Install `yay -S hfsutils` to support RW of hfs partitions. if the parition is mounted **ro** more than likely the system was shutdown abruptly and running a file system check `fschk` on the HFS partition will allow mounting the partition with RW after the check is completed.

my most recent boot failure happened after upgrading all system packages on my arch linux install using `yay -Syu`. to make matters worse i'm running arch on a macbook without an internal display, and FWR the std <kbd>option</kbd> is not [diplaying][ul1] any bootable disks or even displaying the boot menu

fortunately [resetting][ul2] the nvram _wait for **2 chimes**_ and the grub menu entry displays arch linux and advanced options

> use <kbd>tab</kbd> for a list of cmds & completions

- press <kbd>c</kbd> to enter into the grub console.
- enable the pager `set pager=1`

next, either attempt to boot from existing linux image and ramdisk or use the ones provided by an iso ie. a archlinux install disk

1. determine partition layouts of disks

```
grub> ls
```

2. set the root partition

> numbers will vary depending up partition layout

```
set root (hd0,3)
```

3. set the path the linux kernel and the root partition

```

```

4. set the path the **initrd**

> if attempting to boot from an arch ISO, set this to the path of the ISO file??? [double check]

```
initrd /boot
```

5. finally tell grub to boot the linux kernel and system

```
boot
```

A good [reference/explanation][ul3] of the above procedure
