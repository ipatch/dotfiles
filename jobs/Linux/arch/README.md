## pacman

<a name="pacman"></a>

- to generate a list of installed packages

```shell
pacman -Qqen > pkglist.txt
pacman -Qqem > pkglist_aur.txt
```

in troubleshooting _x11vnc_ i'm running `x11vnc -findauth`, but the switch/option could not complete due to my system missing `netstat`.

**Q** how would i know which package provided by _pacman_ or _aur_ would install `netstat`

```
pacman -F netstat
yay -F netstat
```

## arch/macbook _11.x_ specific

<a name="arch-on-macbook"></a>

i checked in the `$PWD/etc/default/grub` to source control for helping me remember adding `acpi_mask_gpe=0x06` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` argument. after adding this arg to above such line the computer went from idling at ~ 70C üî• to idling around ~ 40C ~= 100F ü•∂

### networking

<a name="networking"></a>

for my particular use case, i want to setup a bridge interface with my wired ethernet via my thunderbolt adapter, and give the interface a static ip address of **10.0.1.111**

see **troubleshooting** section for my notes related to networking

there are multiple ways and utilities for assigning static ip addresses within archlinux, ~~for my needs i'm using a combination of **NetworkManager** along with **netctl** to create a static ip address, a bridge interface **br0** along with a **tap0** interface.~~

## i3

i wanted to display RPM speed of both the left and right fans inside my i3status bar.

- https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/i3status.1.html

i3status doesn't directly support calling/running shell scripts from what i understand, so i implemented a script that calls i3status and prints the fan speeds while running i3status at the same time.

### troubleshooting / networking

<a name="troubleshooting-networking"></a>

in short, i have the 3 three most recent major versions of macos working with qemu and kvm on my arch mbp box. (yay me). now my current limitation is being able to use a bridge/tap interface with all 3 virtual machines running at the same time. previously i had been using _netctl_ to manage a static ip address for the arch box, ie. `10.0.1.111`. did a little digging this afternoon, and think i'll give `nmcli` a try for managing the network interfaces on this archbox mbp. `nmcli` is a confusing little cli utility for creating network devices and connections and becomes more confusing the more you use it (ugggggh).

the _foxlet/macos-simple-kvm_ repo provides a [decent guide][1] for setting up bridge networking for a macos vm running under KVM. however, when one wants to start tweaking the settings with little knowledge of _network manager_ & _nmcli_ things can get confusing.

nmcli can be used to create a static ip address for an interface, for my use case, i created a bridge interface similar to the one in the foxlet guide, but tweaked some nmcli settings to give it a static ip of `10.0.1.111`. thus allowing to not have to fiddle with dhcp and all the third party apps running on the box, and also makes the box a tad bit easier to reach from misc devices.

the two basic nmcli commands one should know are,

```
nmcli con show
nmcli dev st
```

> think of the _DEVICE_ as the old networking names ie. `en0` and what not. whereas the _NAME_ refers to the _connection name_ an arbitrary string assigned by nmcli.

also another thing to remember that nmcli allows editing/modifying the current settings for a network connection, so before you go deleting everything it may behoove you to edit some settings before blowing everything up. after editing settings using nmcli, use the _apply_ sub command, and possibly bring down then up the interface that is actively being edited.

and while mucking with all my network related settings i managed to break my vnc viewer, so manually connecting the archbox is presently required.

### troubleshooting / networking / vnc

i'm using _x11vnc_ to allow me to connect to my archbox via _vnc viewer.app_ on macos to view my std X11 desktop. however after mucking around with my networking settings, vnc viewer is not wanting to connect.

**Q** howto troubleshoot not being able to connect to `/usr/bin/Xvnc`

### troubleshooting / zfs

i've run into several instances where i attempt to mount my ext USB drive using `zfs import` and am i presented with something similar to _zfs module not loaded etc. etc._

***hypothesis*** i've run a system update _yay_ and have updated all packages on the system, but have yet to reboot the system. for whatever reason i think this is preventing the zfs module from loading. ...will attempt to restart computer after all pkg installations have been completed.

**correct** ‚úÖ rebooting my archlinux box, followd by running, `sudo -E /sbin/modprobe zfs` loaded the zfs modules for my running kernel.

### troubleshooting / fail to boot üò≠

<a name="tshoot-fail-to-boot"></a>

**my rant**, boot failures always suck and happen at the worst time ü§¶

**TL;DR** ‚ùóÔ∏è make sure `/boot` partition is writable when upgrading `linux` & `linux-headers`, for me, my HFS `/boot` partition was mounted as _read-only_. Install `yay -S hfsutils` to support RW of hfs partitions. if the partition is mounted **ro** more than likely the system was shutdown abruptly and running a file system check `fschk` on the HFS partition will allow mounting the partition with RW after the check is completed.

my most recent boot failure happened after upgrading all system packages on my arch linux install using `yay -Syu`. to make matters worse i'm running arch on a macbook **without** an internal display, and FWR the typical _hold the_ <kbd>option</kbd> _key during boot_ is not [displaying][ul1] any bootable disks or even displaying the boot menu

fortunately [resetting][ul2] the nvram _wait for **2 chimes**_ and the grub menu entry displays arch linux and advanced options

> use <kbd>tab</kbd> for a list of cmds & completions

- press <kbd>c</kbd> to enter into the grub console.
- enable the pager `set pager=1`

next, either attempt to boot from existing linux image and ramdisk or use the ones provided by an iso ie. a archlinux install disk

1. determine partition layouts of disks

```
grub> ls
```

2. set the root partition

> numbers will vary depending up partition layout

```
set root (hd0,3)
```

3. set the path the linux kernel and the root partition

```

```

4. set the path the **initrd**

> if attempting to boot from an arch ISO, set this to the path of the ISO file??? [double check]

```
initrd /boot
```

5. finally tell grub to boot the linux kernel and system

```
boot
```

A good [reference/explanation][ul3] of the above procedure

## experimenting with libvirt/libvirtd

- with my current arch linux install there is no `/etc/network/interfaces` file.

- archlinux does not use the above mentioned file, as that is a _debianism_, network manager can used used to setup a bridge with tun/tap [learn more][ul9]

- while experimenting with libvirtd to manage vms, when using `systemctl` to status libvirtd, the following error msg appeared
  `libvirtd cannot check dnsmasq binary /usr/bin/dnsmasq: no such file or directory`
  install dnsmasq

- next error, `cannot find 'dmidecode' in path: no such file or directory`
- setup **pollkit**, install **dmidecode**, no fiddlig with a pollkit agent so far.

- next error, upon launching `virt-manager`

  ```
  virt-manager unable to connect to libvrit qemu:///system authentication unavailable
  ```

  **answer**, add $USER launching `virt-manager` to the `libvirt` user group

- next error, 

  ```
  virt-manager error starting domain: requested operation is not valid: network 'default' is not active
  ```

  **answer**, the **default** network has to be defined using an XML file [learn more][ul10]

  ```shell
  sudo virsh net-define /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/default.xml
  sudo virsh net-autostart default
  sudo virsh net-start default
  sudo virsh net-list --all
  ```

- next error, [useful link **bbs.archlinuxr.og**][ul11]

  ```
  error starting domain: cannot access storage file as uid gid permission denied
  ```

  **answer**, edit `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf`
