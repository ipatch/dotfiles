## OBS Settings

The **obs-studio/basic** combined directories is a 1:1 copy of my OBS settings from macOS _10.13.6_ circa November 2019.  There is another directory named **obs-exports** which contains the settings from OBS using the builtin **export** features within the OBS app itself, as oppsed to directly copying the settings beneath the **Application Support** directory on macOS.

OBS provides a feature within the app where one can import settings, and if I'd have to choose how I would apply the OBS settings from the sub directories within this directory I'd use the builtin **import** utility provided by the OBS app itself to expierment with the settings from this repo.
